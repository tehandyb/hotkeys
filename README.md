# hotkeys
Hotkeys that allow me to move my hands as little as possible when programming, or pressing play on music

## Current key maps:

### No-hand-lift Arrow keys
Press Right shift + a|s|d|w to use asdw as arrow keys

### Music player controls
Press Right shift + spacebar to pause and play system music

## OS compatibility and versioning
The lua script is written for Hammerspoon 0.9.97. I believe this is only MacOS compatible, works with macOS Monteray. Might need to make tweaks for other OS or hammerspoon versions.
